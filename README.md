How to use each subroutine which I have tested.

First load the anaconda prompt environment in the current folder and activate the Downloads environment

`conda activate Downloads`

## Downloads_VidDown

* Command:
`python Downloads_VidDown -a -url "pasteurl"`

It still does not download playlists in mp3 format for that you should use:

`python Downloads_Playlist -url "pasteurl"`

It will automatically download the mp3 playlist to the Downloads/MP3/ folder
